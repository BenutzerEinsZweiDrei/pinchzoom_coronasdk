# easy multitouch pinch zoom corona labs sdk
Pinch, zoom and scale something

This simple code allows for using multitouch to scale and so zoom in and out

it is an easy to use version which compares the distances between two fingers on multitouch. if it gets bigger - you zoom in or the other way around

i didnt need all the functions of the master branch so created this use case
