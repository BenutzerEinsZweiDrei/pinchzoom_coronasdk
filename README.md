# pinchzoom_coronasdk
Pinch, zoom, scroll and touch an image

This simple code allows an image in Corona SDK to operate as multitouch and singletouch with the one function.
Pinch and zoom at any point of the image, auto centres where you touched.

Use as single touch to scroll or create a hit spot (a hit is assumed as a touch that movesd less than x pixels)

An image is available in the issues section
Change the width and height in code if you use a different image
